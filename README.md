# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning
It is a big challenge to predict how the stock market performs given various factors like people sentiments, fundamentals of the company etc. The stock prices of all the listed companies fluctuate everyday and it is very helpful if we can get an insight on how the stock has performed over the past years and predict the future price of the stock. In this project, the aim is to leverage 5 different machine learning models to compare the results of these models and choose the model with best results to predict future price of the stock. The results of the experiment show that LSTM model has the potential to predict the future price of the stock most accurately
